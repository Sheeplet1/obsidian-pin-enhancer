# Obsidian Pin Enhancer

Enhances standard pin functionality by preventing pinned tabs from being
closed.

-   Prevents pinned tabs from being closed with middle-click
-   Adds alternative commands for the user to rebind standard hotkeys for close
    commands to.

**DOES NOT**
- 	Block the context menu close buttons (might consider in the future, but for now it
  	is an easy way to close pinned tabs)
- 	Have all alternative keybinds for close commands (does not have "Close this tab group",
  	"Close others in tab group"
